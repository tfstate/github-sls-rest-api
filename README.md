# Terraform Remote State Management using a GitHub Token

[Scaffoldly](https://scaffold.ly) provides [a remote state backend]() for secure
Terraform State hosting using a GitHub Token.

Features:

- Zero Bootstrapping: if you have a GitHub token, you can use this API
- [Hosted API](https://api.tfstate.dev/github/swagger.html) in AWS Lambda + API
  Gateway in AWS courtsey of [Scaffoldly](https://scaffold.ly)
- [Encrypted State](src/services/StateService.ts#L27)
- State Locking

âœ… We do not store or save the provided GitHub token.

## Usage

### 1. Create a `tfstate.tfbackend` file with a GitHub Token with `repo` or `repo:read` access to the Repository specified by `username`:

```hcl
username = "my-org/my-repo"
password = "ghp_abcd..."
```

_Note_: Be sure to exclude `tfstate.tfbackend` from source control in the `.gitignore`.
_Note_: This can be a Personal Access Token or a token generated by GitHub OAuth

### 2. Configure Terraform for Remote State

```hcl
terraform {
  backend "http" {
    address        = "https://api.tfstate.dev/github/v1"
    lock_address   = "https://api.tfstate.dev/github/v1/lock"
    unlock_address = "https://api.tfstate.dev/github/v1/lock"
    lock_method    = "PUT"
    unlock_method  = "DELETE"
  }
}
```

### 3. Initialize Terraform

```bash
terraform init -backend-config=tfstate.tfbackend -reconfigure [-migrate-state]
```

_Note_: If you have a token that rotates regularly (such as Server-to-Server) tokens
generated by a GitHub Application, you will need to run `-reconfigure` each time
the token rotates.

See the [Terraform Docs](https://www.terraform.io/cli/commands/init#backend-initialization)
for specifics on migrating existing state.

# About Scaffoldly and `tfstate.dev`

[Scaffoldly](https://scaffold.ly) provides various services and automations to
simplify Infrastructure Bootstrapping and DevOps.

`tfstate.dev` is provided as a free and easy way to store Terraform State. We've
open sourced it for transparency to show how it handles and secures Terraform state.

We were inspired by [GitLab's ability](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/infrastructure/iac/terraform_state.html)
to host Terraform State, and wanted the same functionality for GitHub.

Scaffoldly is not affiliated with GitHub.

## Want to host `github-sls-rest-api` in your own AWS Account?
