# Terraform State Storage HTTP Backend

**TFstate.dev** is a free [Terraform State Provider](https://www.terraform.io/language/settings/backends/http) and [Open Source Hosted Service](https://github.com/tfstate/github-sls-rest-api) for secure Terraform Remote State hosting using a GitHub Token, courtsey of [Scaffoldly](https://scaffold.ly)

Features:

- GitHub Token used for Authentication and Authorization to Terraform State
- Encrypted State in Amazon S3 using Amazon KMS
- State Locking
- Highly available [Hosted API](https://api.tfstate.dev/github/swagger.html) in AWS Lambda + API Gateway
- Plug and Play: Only a GitHub Token is needed to use TFstate.dev

âœ… We do not store or save the provided GitHub token.

## Getting started ðŸš€

First, a GitHub token is needed. This can be a [Personal Access Token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token), a [GitHub Actions Secret](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/automatic-token-authentication), or any other form of [GitHub Oauth Token](https://github.blog/2021-04-05-behind-githubs-new-authentication-token-formats/). At a minimum, the token needs `repo:read` access for the configured repository.

âž¡ See our [example repository](https://github.com/tfstate/example).

To use TFstate.dev in Terraform, add the following [backend configuration](https://www.terraform.io/language/settings/backends/http) to Terraform:

```hcl
terraform {
  backend "http" {
    address        = "https://api.tfstate.dev/github/v1"
    lock_address   = "https://api.tfstate.dev/github/v1/lock"
    unlock_address = "https://api.tfstate.dev/github/v1/lock"
    lock_method    = "PUT"
    unlock_method  = "DELETE"
    username       = "{your-github-org}/{your-github-repo}"
  }
}
```

Then, Terraform can be configured to use the TFstate.dev backend using the GitHub token:

```bash
terraform init -backend-config="password={your-github-token}"
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

Alternatively, the `TF_HTTP_PASSWORD` environment variable can be set with the GitHub token:

```bash
export TF_HTTP_PASSWORD="{your-github-token}"
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

### Developing/Contributing to this API

We'd love contributions from the community to improve this API.

#### Running

Requirements:

- NodeJS 14+
- Yarn

Running instructions:

1. Fork and clone this repo
1. Run `yarn`
1. Run `yarn start` (launches Serverless in Local mode)

The main controller is [`ControllerV1`](src/controllers/ControllerV1.ts). It contains the primary endpoints for State Storage.

Once running locally, the OpenAPI docs can be found at:

https://localhost:3000/github/swagger.html

#### Verifying Locally

While running the API locally, create a basic Terraform structure to test state functions:

```hcl
terraform {
  backend "http" {
    address        = "http://localhost:3000/github/v1"
    lock_address   = "http://localhost:3000/github/v1/lock"
    unlock_address = "http://localhost:3000/github/v1/lock"
    lock_method    = "PUT"
    unlock_method  = "DELETE"

    # Make sure this is a real repository that your token has access to
    username       = "{your-github-user}/github-sls-rest-api"
  }
}

resource "null_resource" "example" {

}

output "null_resource_id" {
  value = null_resource.example.id
}
```

Then, run:

```bash
export TF_HTTP_PASSWORD={your-github-token}
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

Other command to verify with:

```bash
terraform state ...
terraform force-unlock ...
```
