## OpenAPI / Swagger

within [src/controllers](src/controllers), an OpenAPI spec is automatically
generated.

Running locally, you can view the Swagger/OpenAPI at:

## Deployments / Versioning

### Nonlive

Nonlive deployments are **automatic**. A push to `main` will automatically
trigger a release to `Nonlive`. The project's version will also be incremented
upon a successful build with a preversion identifier, e.g. `x.y.z-#`.

### Live

To release to the `Live` environment, navigate to the
[most recent release](./releases), click 'Edit' then 'Publish Release', which
will trigger a `Live` release. The project's version will also be incremented
to the next patch version, e.g. `x.y.(z+1)`.
